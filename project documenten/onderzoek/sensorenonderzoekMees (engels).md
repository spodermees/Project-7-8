# How the Beam Spread of the Sensor Affects Measurements

## What is a Beam?

The beam is a general term used for the emitted and/or received radiation used to take a measurement.
This can be a light beam, infrared, or even an X-ray beam.
Sensors that utilize this technology use it to measure objects and distances by detecting interruptions and changes.

## What is Beam Diameter?

The beam diameter (also known as spot size) is the width of the beam a sensor uses to detect objects. A smaller beam diameter makes it easier to distinguish individual objects, while a larger beam diameter may cause multiple objects to be perceived as a single entity.

Several important terms are relevant here:

- Beam Divergence
The extent to which the beam spreads over a distance. This is crucial to ensure that multiple objects are not mistakenly detected as a single unit.

- Focal Distance
The distance at which the beam is the ‘sharpest.’

- Detection Resolution
How accurately the sensor can distinguish between objects.

## How Does Beam Diameter Affect Measurements?

There are several ways in which the beam/beam diameter influences measurements, which must be considered when selecting sensors for the boat.
Since the terms small beam and large beam are used, in this context, a small beam refers to 1-5mm, and a large beam refers to 10-50mm.

1. Measurement Resolution

- Small beam: A smaller beam can provide more precise measurements because it covers a smaller area. This is especially important in applications where precision is required, such as optical sensors for object recognition.

- Large beam: A larger beam provides less detailed information because it covers a broader area and may pick up more noise or interference from environmental factors.

2. Measurement Sharpness

- Small beam: Detecting small, well-defined objects can be challenging since the beam needs to be very precise to hit an object. In some cases, obtaining a strong signal may be difficult if the beam is too narrow.

- Large beam: A larger beam may make it easier to detect objects, even if they are not precisely centered within the beam. However, it may also be less sharp when distinguishing between objects or detecting changes in the measured area.

3. Signal Strength

- Small beam: It can result in higher signal intensity over a small area, which is useful for detecting small amounts of light or specific details. However, it may also be more sensitive to minor deviations or disturbances.

- Large beam: A broader beam distributes the signal over a larger area, which weakens the average signal but also makes it less sensitive to minor disturbances.

4. Measurement Range

- Small beam: A smaller beam may limit the measurement range to a specific, confined area. This is useful for detailed, localized measurements but less effective for detecting larger areas.

- Large beam: A broader beam can cover a larger area, which is beneficial for measuring or detecting objects across a broader range. However, this may come at the cost of precision.

5. Interference and Noise

- Small beam: The risk of interference is higher because small deviations in the sensor or environment can have a greater impact on measurements.

- Large beam: A broader beam is less affected by minor disturbances, as the signal is spread across a larger area. However, it may also pick up more background noise.

6. Motion Sensitivity

- Small beam: When tracking fast-moving objects, a small beam may struggle to keep up with movement because it needs to react quickly to position changes.

- Large beam: A broader beam can more easily track objects moving across a larger area but may be less precise in tracking specific movements.

## Conclusion

After analyzing all the ways beam diameter affects measurements and comparing these factors against the requirements, the decision was made to use the smallest possible beam diameter wherever feasible.
